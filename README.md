Capital Markets | Quantitative Finance | Risk Analytics | Python | FRM | CQF (2026)

I'm transitioning into quantitative finance and algorithmic research after 18+ years in Capital Markets, Fixed Income, Derivatives, and Risk.
I am currently building strong foundations in:
Python for Finance & Data Analysis
Time-Series & Statistical Modelling
Option Pricing Models (Black–Scholes, Greeks)
Monte Carlo Simulation
Competitive Programming (Codeforces)
CQF 2026 preparation

🔬 Quant Projects (In Progress)
📈 Time-Series Analysis (trend, moving averages)
🎯 Black-Scholes Pricing Model
🎲 Monte Carlo Simulation for stock prices
🔢 Value-at-Risk (basic portfolio VaR)
📊 Financial dataset analysis (exploratory insights)
➡️ All projects will be available soon in:
quant-projects-lokesh

🧠 Currently Learning
Python: 100 Days of Code (Angela Yu) — Day 9
Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Data Structures & Algorithms
Contest problem solving (Codeforces)
